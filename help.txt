Yahtzee Help

How to Play:

There are 5 Dice at the bottom of the window, which are rolled up to 3 times each turn, for 13 turns.
In each turn, you pick a score, either at the end of your 3 rolls, or when there is a combination you wish to score.
During the 3 rolls, you can also hold dice, so they are not rolled when "Roll the Dice" is selected.

Scoring:

Each possible score with the dice will be displayed when the dice are rolled. Each score can only be selected once.

Upper Section: 
For each dice value, the sum of the specified value is the score. For example, four "two's" and an "ace" would score 8.
The bonus of 35 points is given when the upper total of 63 is reached, or an average of 3 dice of each value is scored.

Lower Section:
3 of a Kind: When 3 of the dice show the same value, 3 of a kind is scored with the total of all dice values.
4 of a Kind: When 4 of the dice show the same value, 4 of a kind is scored with the total of all dice values.
Full House: A Full House is scored when there is 3 of one value and 2 of another. E.g. 4,4,4,1,1. A full house scores 25 points.
Small Straight: When four dice have successive values, e.g. 2,3,4,5,3. A Small Straight scores 30 points.
Large Straight: When all five dice have succesive values, e.g. 2,3,4,5,6. A Large Straight scores 40 points.
Yahtzee!: When all five dice show the same value. A Yahtzee scores 50 points.
Chance: Chance is determined by the sum of all dice. There is no pattern required, this is an option for when there are no other combinations.
